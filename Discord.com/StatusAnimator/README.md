Below, you can see all the animation "blocks" you can use to construct your "animation script". Manually edit the script's ```loop()``` function and construct your animation using the blocks. (Copy & paste a block, edit the values inside its parenthesis) 

## Animation Blocks

<details open>
<summary open>Animation blocks</summary><br>

Wait a selected amount of milliseconds before continuing to the next block
```js
await wait(ms);
```
Blank status - Doesn't touch the state, but will make the emoji and text blank
```js
await blank();
```
Set status's state - There are four options: invisible, dnd, idle and online
```js
await state("state");
```
Set status's emoji - This will clear the text
```js
await emoji("emoji");
```
Set status's text - This will clear the emoji
```js
await text("text");
```
Edit the status
```js
await status("emoji","text","state");
```
Skip - If you're using multiple skips on the same animation, make sure to use a different identifier for each one
```js
if(await skip(times,"identifier")) return;
```
Typewriter
```js
await typewriter("emoji","text",timeout,reversed);
```
Glitch - Randomizes a string multiple times
```js
await glitch("emoji","text",times,timeout);
```
Glitchtype - Typewriter + empty spaces are filled with glitch effect
```js
await glitchtype("emoji","text",timeout,glitch_rate,reversed);
```
Sentence - Automatically splits a sentence and updates the status one word at a time
```js
await sentence("emoji","text",timeout);
```
Blink - Blink x amount of times every x milliseconds
```js
await blink("emoji","text",timeout,times);
```
Count - Simply count from 1 -> X or if reversed then from X -> 1
```js
await count("emoji","prefix",count_to,"suffix",timeout,reversed);
```
Activity - Positive if user is on the Discord tab, negative if not
 ```js
 await activity("positive_emoji","positive_text","positive_state","negative_emoji","negative_text","negative_state");
 ```
Scroll - Move the text sideways - Center amount means how many times it will move the full text sideways
```js
await scroll("emoji","text",timeout,center_amount,reversed);
```

#### Examples

Do remember that Discord doesn't update your status as fast for others. Many of the examples you see here do not show up to others. Please slow them down if you want others to properly see every change.
