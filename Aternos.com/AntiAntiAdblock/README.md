### Why doesn't the script work?

* Aternos's developers are hunting AntiAntiAdblock scripts. With the current methods, they can easily change a little detail on their code, which renders the script useless, unable to find its wanted element or variable.
* Because of that, keeping an AntiAntiAdblock script public and updated is madness.

### Can I make it work? 

* For sure, certainly you can. It's very easy to bypass the Anti-Adblock once the developers don't know how you're doing it, they can't make any countermeasures. *This* is the core reason why *you* need to make your own edits, or completely rewrite the script.

### How will I do that?

* You'll need to study and reverse engineer the website's structure, and figure out how the Anti-Adblock element is loaded. I can teach you on the current (12.12.2021) ways they do it, but can't predict the future.
* If the site's structure has been changed, you might need some JavaScript knowledge.
